                <p type="history">
                    The greenspace called 'Kensington Gardens' was the deer park acquired by 
                    <persName type="King">Henry VIII</persName>.
                    It belonged to <placeName type="palace">Kensington palace</placeName> - and there is a good case for 
                    calling it '<placeName type="garden">Kensington Park'</placeName>. 
                    <persName type="royalMale">William III</persName> bought 
                    <term type="architecture">Nottingham House</term> for 
                    <num type="price" value="2000">£20,000</num> and converted it into 
                    <placeName type="palace">Kensington Palace</placeName>. 
                    <placeName>Kensington Park</placeName>' was made on land taken from 
                    <placeName type="park">Hyde Park</placeName> by <persName type="royalFemale">Queen Caroline</persName> 
                    (Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach, the wife of <persName type="royalMale">King George II</persName>). 
                    She employed <persName type="designer">Charles Bridgeman</persName> from <date when="1728-1738">1728-1738</date> 
                    to make a <emph type="gardenStyle">Baroque Style</emph> park, including 
                    the <placeName type="inside"><geogName type="avenues">avenues</geogName></placeName> 
                    and the <placeName type="inside"><geogName type="pond">Round Pond</geogName></placeName>. 
                    
                </p>
        
                <p type="design">
                    There was a <term type="architecture">bastioned wall</term> 
                    on <measure type="east">the east of boundary</measure> of '<placeName type="garden">Kensington Park</placeName>', 
                    on the line of what is now <placeName type="inside">the West Carriage Drive</placeName>, 
                    as shown on <persName type="designer">John Rocque</persName>'s <date when="1756">1756</date> plan.
                    Like a Ha-Ha in a landscape garden, the aim was to give a view of the surrounding countryside 
                    (in this case, <placeName type="park">Hyde Park</placeName>).
                    <persName type="designer">Charles Bridgeman</persName> is regarded as a 'transitional' designer and his biographer, 
                    <persName type="biographer">Peter Willis</persName>, saw him as a key figure in genesis of the landscape garden. 
                    If this is correct, then one can find evidence of 'the great revolution in taste' within 
                    the perimeter of <placeName type="garden">Kensington Gardens</placeName> and <placeName type="park">Hyde Park</placeName>.

                    <measure type="west">The western part</measure> of <placeName type="garden">Kensington Gardens</placeName>, 
                    around <placeName type="palace">the Palace</placeName>, was definitely <emph type="gardenStyle">baroque</emph>.
                    The eastern section, where <placeName type="inside"><geogName type="avenues">the avenues</geogName></placeName> 
                    approach <placeName type="inside"><geogName type="lake">the Long Water</geogName></placeName>, is an 
                    early example of what became <emph type="gardenStyle">the Serpentine Style</emph>. 
                    <placeName type="park">Hyde Park</placeName>, with its 
                    <placeName><geogName type="lake">Serpentine lake</geogName></placeName>, 
                    was an early project in what was to become '<emph type="gardenStyle">the style of William Kent and Lancelot Brown</emph>'. 
                    The best point to see the transition is <term type="architecture">the Queen's Temple</term>, 
                    shown by the red marker baloon on the map below.
                    It was built as a feature in a bosquet and now has the appearance of a Temple in a landscape garden.

                    A vast development in the City of London.
                    To some, it is a forest of tower blocks.
                    For others, there are many exciting features including 
                    <term type="architecture"> type="fountains,cascade,roof garden,trees,pools,sitting area">massed fountains, 
                    a cascade, roof gardens, trees growing on columns, great pools and 
                    a sitting area</term> which is set below water level.
                    It is a prime example of <emph type="gardenStyle">the Abstract Modern design style</emph>.
                    However, many of the spaces are bleak and draughty. 
                    Extensive pedestrian decks cover the parking areas and access roads. 
                </p>
        
                <p type="design">
                    The scheme was designed by <persName type="designer">Chamberlain Powell</persName> 
                    and <persName type="designer">Bon</persName> 
                    in the <date when="1950s">1950s</date> and is now almost complete.
                    Visitors joke that it is almost impossible to find one's way about. 
                    This has been countered by painting lines on the brick paviors.
                    One can follow them, as Theseus followed his string to escape from the Labyrinth.
                        
                </p>
        
                <p type="planting">
                    
                    The original planting of the roof gardens included <term type="plants">lawns, flower beds, 
                    trees and shrubs</term>, which required continual irrigation and a high maintenance regime.
                    
                    In <date when="2013">2013</date> the planting was revised by <persName type="designer">Nigel Dunnett</persName> to 
                    create three â€˜Designed Plant Communitiesâ€™ relating to the amout of sunshine the areas receive:
                        
                    1. <term type="plants">STEPPE plantings</term> in full sun.
                    Mixtures of <term type="plants">grasses and perennials</term> that are naturally adapted to dry, 
                    exposed conditions.
                    This is the main planting type across the site.
                    Very colourful, with jewel-like colours, diverse foliage textures and plant forms.

                    2. <term type="plants">SHRUB STEPPE plantings</term> which combine similar mixes of perennials and 
                    grasses to the steppe plantings, 
                    but with additional low-density shrubs and multi-stemmed trees, to create multi-layered plantings 
                    with year-round structure and interest.
                        
                    3. <term type="plants">LIGHT WOODLAND plantings</term> in part-shade, and where the growing medium 
                    depths enable tree growth.
                    Multi-stem trees, widely spaced create a light, open canopy, with a scattered understory of shrubs, 
                    and a diverse perennial ground layer.

                    The <date when="1720s">1720s</date> garden was sufficiently changed by 'landscape' ideas for 
                    <persName type="writer">Alexander Pope</persName>
                    to see it as the first garden in which 'the genius of the place' had been consulted. 
                    <persName type="designer">Lord Burlington</persName>, the owner and chief designer, 
                    was helped by <persName type="designer">Charles Bridgeman</persName> and <persName type="designer">William Kent</persName>.
                    They aimed to make an <emph type="gardenStyle">Augustan style</emph> villa and garden.

                <p type="scenery">
                    The architecture was modelled on Palladio's 1550 Villa Rotunda.
                    <term type="architecture">Buildings and obilisks</term> were placed at the ends of 
                    <placeName type="inside"><geogName type="avenue">avenues</geogName></placeName>,

                    helped to re-create <emph type="gardenStyle">the landscape of antiquity</emph>.

                    The area between the house and the canal, occupied by <term type="architecture">a maze</term> 
                    in <date when="1730">1730</date>, was the first to be treated in this way. 
                    Since <emph type="gardenStyle">Kent's style</emph> became influential, we are fortunate that it survives. 
                    The garden was in poor condition when <persName type="architect">Frank Clark</persName> (quoted below) complained about its condition.
                    It has been restored, but since there were five important stages in the garden's evolution,
                    it was a difficult task. 
                    The plans show the garden as it is today and as it was in <date when="1730">1736</date>.
                    One sees the change from a nobleman's country estate to an urban park. 

Stage 1: a <date when="1707">1707</date> drawing by <persName type="painter">Leonrard Knyff</persName> showed 
                    a simple <emph type="gardenStyle">renaissance</emph> garden with <term type="plants">grass plats and knots</term>. 
                    This has gone, except for the path on the north front of the house.

                    Stage 2: by <date when="1730">1730</date> <persName type="designer">Lord Burlington</persName> 
                    had made a <emph type="gardenStyle">'Roman'</emph> garden 
                    which drew something from the <emph type="gardenStyle">Baroque</emph> and something from <persName type="painter">Robert Castell</persName>'s 
                    Villas of the ancients.
                    It had <placeName type="inside"><geogName type="avenue">avenues</geogName></placeName>,

                    <term type="architecture">an amphitheatre, a maze and several small pavilions</term>.

                    Stage 3: by <date when="1733">1733</date> <persName type="designer">William Kent</persName> was recognised as 
                    having introduced 'the natural taste in gardening', probably in the area between <term type="architecture">the house</term> and <placeName>the canal</placeName>. 
                    <term type="architecture">The maze</term> was removed and the area treated in a manner which became famous as 
                    <emph type="gardenStyle">'the English style'</emph>.

                    Stage 4: by <date when="1753">1753</date>, the year of <persName type="designer">Lord Burlington</persName>'s death,
                    <term type="architecture">the exedra</term> was planted, <term type="plants">an orangery</term> built 
                    and more of the land fronting the canal 'naturalised' by removing the basins of water.

                    <orgName type="owner">Westminster Council</orgName> then went through years of consultation,

                    from <placeName>Lambeth Bridge</placeName> to <placeName>Tower Bridge</placeName>. 
                    The idea grew out of <persName type="designer">Patrick Abercrombie</persName>'s 
                    <date when="1943-1944">1943-4</date> County of London Plan.
                    As shown on the map, Abercrombie proposed that much of this land
                    should be converted from industry to Public Buildings, Business and Public Open Space.
                    The <date when="1951">1951</date> Festival of Britain led to the first section of the walk,
                    running <measure type="east">east</measure> from <placeName>Westminster Bridge</placeName>. 
                    A more extensive walkway was conceived as part of the <date when="1977">1977</date> <placeName>Jubliee Walkway</placeName>,
                    to mark the Silver Jubilee of <persName type="royalFemale">Queen Elizabeth II</persName> in <date when="1977">1977</date>.
                    The walk was completed with the opening of London Bridge City c.<date when="1990">1990</date>. 
                    In <date when="1996">1996</date>, <placeName type="garden">the Queen's Walk</placeName> became part of 
                    <term type="architecture">the Thames Path national trail</term> through London.
                    With the opening of <term type="architecture">the London Eye</term> and <term type="architecture">the Millennium Bridge</term>

                    the volume of pedestrian traffic
                    on <placeName type="garden">the Queen's Walk</placeName> increased dramatically. 
                    Most of the route can also be used by cyclists.

                    which receives special design consideration.
                    The name comes from <term type="architecture">the Dolphin lamp</term> standards - 
                    but the  'Dolphins' are actually a pair of sturgeons. 
                    The lamps were designed by <persName type="designer">George Vuillamy</persName>
